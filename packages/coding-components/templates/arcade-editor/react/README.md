This repository showcases how to integrate the Arcade editor using React.

This template was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/).

```
yarn create react-app [NAME]
```

## Dependencies

Requires [`react-scripts`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scripts) >= 5.0.0

> If you'd prefer not to use `react-scripts` >= 5.0.0, then you may need additional loaders and/or plugins in your configuration (`webpack.config.js`, `babel.config.js`, etc.).

## Project setup

### Install dependencies

Installs any package that the Arcade editor depends on.

```
yarn install
```

### Start the development server

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the Editor in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

```
yarn run start
```

### Generate the production-ready compiled code

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

```
yarn run build
```
